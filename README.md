📊 Zomato Performance Analysis with Power BI

This project presents a detailed analysis of Zomato's sales, user activity, and city-wise performance using dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboards.

🚀 Project Overview
Through exploratory data analysis and visual storytelling, this project dives into:
1. Sales patterns across categories (Veg, Non-Veg, Others) and years
2. User behavior by age group, gender, churn, and retention
3. City-level performance, identifying top and underperforming regions

🔍 Key Insights
💰 ₹987M+ revenue generated; Veg items lead in both sales and ratings
📉 Sales peaked in 2018, then declined post-2020
👤 Users aged 22–25 are most active, but also most likely to churn
⚠️ User loss > user gain → highlights gaps in loyalty and retention
🏖️ Cities like Tirupati and Bikaner show strong engagement and loyalty
📍 Areas like Adityapur and Navrangpura need re-engagement due to high user loss or falling sales
